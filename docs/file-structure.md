`app/demo_subset.py` and the `exact_product` retrieval scope remain for backward compatibility. The Real unlisted
product main chain uses `app/domain/peer_data.py`, `PeerGroupService`, and `peer_group` retrieval.
`scripts/smoke_multi_product_matching.py` validates ten terminal-product types without building a global classifier;
`scripts/real_http_e2e.py` exercises the deployed HTTP contract and real providers.
